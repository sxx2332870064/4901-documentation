    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>As an animator who delves into emotional journeys and character growth, my short films are more than stories; they are personal reflections woven into the journey of a neon-lit city. Each frame is a step towards overcoming the shadows of isolation, inspired by my own struggles and observations. Through the characters who navigate the hustle and bustle of the streets and towering buildings, I portray the primal, often unseen battle against the whispered fears of judgment and rejection. Their journey mirrors mine and, I believe, many others - from the trembling hands of a first conversation to the warmth of a smile shared in the light of the city, each moment is a testament to the courage to reach out and the feast that comes from embracing diversity.
            Placed against the stark contrasting backdrop of a city that never sleeps, my animation delves into what it really means to find connection in a cold and alienated place. A lone clock tower recurs across the city's expanse as a poignant reminder of the passage of time, urging us to embrace the present. It is a narrative born from gazing at the city lights at night, contemplating the silent stories behind every window and the unseen threads that may connect us all.
            My creative process is a combination of the emotional and the digital - beginning with abstract and intuitive hand-made pieces that capture the essence of ephemeral emotions, then brought to life through the fluidity and depth of digital animation. This approach allows me to create scenes that pulsate with the vibrant hues of hope and the somber colors of loneliness, creating a visual symphony that speaks directly to the heart. Influenced by the stark contrasts of my urban environments and the intimate dance of light and shadow, my work aims to ignite a spark of identity, reminding us of the transformative power of simple emotional links.
            Through my animations, I invite the viewer to embark on a journey that is both universally resonant and deeply personal. It is an ode to the courage to reach out in a world that often feels overwhelming. My goal is to cultivate a sense of unity and understanding, bridging the gap between us with stories that celebrate connection over the chasm of social anxiety.
